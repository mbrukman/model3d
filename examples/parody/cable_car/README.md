# cable_car

This is a parody of the famous San Francisco cable car. It exports as two pieces: a body, and a separate "roof" (really a lid that can slide into the body). There is text on the side, which can be customized by changing the image `text.png`.

This is loosely modeled after this [toy cable car](https://www.amazon.com/City-Souvenirs-Musical-Francisco-Wooden-Replica/dp/B07X4JM6C4).
